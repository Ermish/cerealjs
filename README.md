# cerealjs
cerealJs is a static site generator library that provides flexibility.

## What makes it different?

- cerealJs is a library and not a framework. This means that you can use it with webpack, parcel, rollup, or your favorite build tool and it doesn't take over your workflow! 
- It is focused around the building your content and not things like bundling that other libraries do better.
